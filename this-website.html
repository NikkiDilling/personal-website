                <p>As I am learning new skills this website is going through multiple design iterations</p>
                <h5 class="section-subtitle">Iteration 1.</h5>
                <p>Using beginner HTML. The content is organized on different pages which can be accessed through links. No detailed project description. No use of color theory. Primary, secondary and accent colors are not picked. Home buttons on 2 different pages use the same CSS but look differently. </p>
                
                <h5 class="section-subtitle">Iteration 2.</h5>
                <p>Primary, secondary and accent colors are picked. Improved and organized HTML containers. Improved navigation and fixed the home page buttons. No detailed project description.</p>

                <h5 class="section-subtitle">Iteration 3.</h5>
                <p>New structure of the page. All information is stored on 1 page to reduce clicking. Added scroll bar percentage in JavaScript (not implemented for mobile devices). Added animation to website sections on scroll using Intersection Observer in JavaScript. No detailed project description.</p>

                <h5 class="section-subtitle">Iteration 3.</h5>
                <p>Going forward I would like to stick with iteration 3 improving the website incrementally. In this iteration I’ve added detailed information about my projects and improved the CSS of the section displaying my projects. Currently I’m working on redesigning the sections, for each to work as a slide show for my skills, projects etc. </p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Issues & Future Changes:</h3>
            
            <p>The challenging part in the development of the site was the functionality that I implemented with JavaScript in the “programming skills” section. If the user clicks on the icon displaying the skill it will scale up and display the name of the skill, then on the second click it will scale down and the label will disappear.</p>
